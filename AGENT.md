# AGENT.md — cross-iteration memory

Things future iterations need to know. The loop appends here; humans curate.

## Architecture / where things are

- `pdf2ereader.py` — the whole tool. Key functions:
  - `page_content_bbox()` / `stable_crop_boxes()` — margin detection (even/odd,
    outlier-trimmed). Solid; leave alone unless evidence says otherwise.
  - `region_atoms()` — indivisible units (text *lines*, images, drawings) in a
    region. The granularity that page breaks must respect.
  - `pack_slices()` — groups atoms into screen-height slices, cutting only
    between atoms (no line ever bisected, no overlap). Oversized atom (big
    figure) goes alone and is scaled down whole.
  - `two_col_regions()` + `estimate_gutter()` + `_merge_y_bands()` — 2-col layout:
    full-width spans become their own full-width region; column bands split
    left-then-right. This is what fixed MonoBite's tiny font.
  - `emit_region()` — places a clip on a device page, width-fit, top-aligned,
    6pt margin (`PAGE_MARGIN`).
  - `run_crop()` / `run_split()` — the three modes. `choose_mode()` — auto.
- `render_samples.py` — render output pages to `diag/*.png` for visual checks.
- Device target: 6" => 257.3 x 347.5 pt (`kindle6` preset, default).

## How to verify (do this EVERY iteration — do not skip)

1. `.venv/bin/python pdf2ereader.py "papers/<file>.pdf" -o /tmp/test.pdf`
2. `.venv/bin/python render_samples.py /tmp/test.pdf diag 150`
3. **Read** the `diag/*.png` and judge against PROMPT.md's acceptance bar.
4. Check text preserved: `get_text()` non-empty, page_count > 0.
Only commit after the render actually looks right. Never claim a result you
have not rendered and viewed this iteration.

## Gotchas discovered

- Inputs have Windows `:Zone.Identifier` sidecars. Glob real `*.pdf` only.
- Edits fail silently if `old_string` indentation doesn't match — the file uses
  4-space indent, no tabs. After any edit, run `ast.parse` AND actually convert
  a paper; a parse-OK file can still NameError at runtime.
- fitw/2col re-embed source pages per slice → large output (MIT ~21MB). Fine for
  USB; under the 200MB Send-to-Kindle limit.
- A full-width text line is ~535pt wide; fitting it to a 257pt screen is ~0.48x
  (small). That's why full-width title bands are small — inherent, not a bug.
  Column-width body text fills the screen and is readable.

## Iteration log (verified, real)

- iter1 (b918f76): region_atoms + pack_slices — fixes cut/occluded lines.
- iter2 (03c9f1f): two_col_regions band-segmentation — fixes 2-col tiny font.
- iter3: emit_region top-align + 6pt margin — consistency/prettiness.

## Conventions

- Keep text vector/selectable (no rasterizing).
- One behavior change per commit; message references the fix_plan item.
- Don't touch crop logic to fix a slicing bug — fix the slicer.
